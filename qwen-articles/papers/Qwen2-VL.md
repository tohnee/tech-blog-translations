###### Abstract

We present the Qwen2-VL Series, an advanced upgrade of the previous Qwen-VL models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in visual processing.
Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism, which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions into different numbers of visual tokens.
This approach allows the model to generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning with human perceptual processes.
The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional information across text, images, and videos.
We employ a unified paradigm for processing both images and videos, enhancing the model’s visual perception capabilities.
To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs).
By scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive performance.
Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models. Code is available at <https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2-VL>.

## Introduction

In the realm of artificial intelligence, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) represent a significant leap forward, building upon the strong textual processing capabilities of traditional large language models. These advanced models now encompass the ability to interpret and analyze a broader spectrum of data, including images, audio, and video. This expansion of capabilities has transformed LVLMs into indispensable tools for tackling a variety of real-world challenges. Recognized for their unique capacity to condense extensive and intricate knowledge into functional representations, LVLMs are paving the way for more comprehensive cognitive systems.
By integrating diverse data forms, LVLMs aim to more closely mimic the nuanced ways in which humans perceive and interact with their environment. This allows these models to provide a more accurate representation of how we engage with and perceive our environment

Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLMs) ([Li et al., 2023c](#bib.bib48); [Liu et al., 2023b](#bib.bib54); [Dai et al., 2023](#bib.bib22); [Zhu et al., 2023](#bib.bib120); [Huang et al., 2023a](#bib.bib34); [Bai et al., 2023b](#bib.bib11); [Liu et al., 2023a](#bib.bib53); [Wang et al., 2023b](#bib.bib99); [OpenAI., 2023](#bib.bib71); [Team et al., 2023](#bib.bib93)) have led to significant improvements in a short span. These models ([OpenAI, 2023](#bib.bib70); [Touvron et al., 2023a](#bib.bib94); [Touvron et al., 2023b](#bib.bib95); [Chiang et al., 2023](#bib.bib21); [Bai et al., 2023a](#bib.bib10)) generally follow a common approach of visual encoder→\rightarrowcross-modal connector→\rightarrowLLM. This setup, combined with next-token prediction as the primary training method and the availability of high-quality datasets ([Liu et al., 2023a](#bib.bib53); [Zhang et al., 2023](#bib.bib118); [Chen et al., 2023b](#bib.bib14); [Li et al., 2023b](#bib.bib47)), has driven much of the progress. Additional factors like larger model architectures ([Alayrac et al., 2022](#bib.bib1)), higher-resolution images ([Li et al., 2023a](#bib.bib46); [Li et al., 2023d](#bib.bib51)), and advanced techniques such as mixture-of-expert models (MoE) ([Wang et al., 2023b](#bib.bib99); [Ye et al., 2023b](#bib.bib108)), model ensembles ([Lin et al., 2023](#bib.bib52)), and more sophisticated connectors ([Ye et al., 2023a](#bib.bib107)) between visual and textual modalities have also played a key role in enhancing LVLMs’ ability to process complex visual and textual information more effectively.

However, current large vision-language models (LVLMs) are typically constrained by a fixed image input size. Standard LVLMs encode input images to a fixed resolution (e.g., 224×224), often by either downsampling or upsampling the images ([Zhu et al., 2023](#bib.bib120); [Huang et al., 2023a](#bib.bib34)), or by employing a scale-then-padding approach ([Liu et al., 2023b](#bib.bib54); [Liu et al., 2023a](#bib.bib53)). While this one-size-fits-all strategy enables processing of images at consistent resolutions, it also limits the model’s ability to capture information at different scales, particularly leading to a significant loss of detailed information in high-resolution images. Consequently, such models fall short of perceiving visual information with the same sensitivity to scale and detail as human vision.

Additionally, most LVLMs rely on a static, frozen CLIP-style ([Radford et al., 2021](#bib.bib78)) vision encoder, raising concerns about whether the visual representations produced by such pre-trained models are adequate, particularly for complex reasoning tasks and processing intricate details within images. Recent works ([Bai et al., 2023b](#bib.bib11); [Ye et al., 2023a](#bib.bib107)) have attempted to address these limitations by fine-tuning the vision transformer (ViT) during the LVLM training process, which has shown to yield improved results. To further enhance the model’s adaptability to varying resolutions, we introduce dynamic resolution training in the LVLM training process. Specifically, we employ a 2D Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in the ViT, thus allowing the model to better capture information across different spatial scales.

When it comes to video content, which is essentially a sequence of frames, many existing models continue to treat it as an independent modality. However, understanding the dynamic nature of reality, as manifested in videos, is crucial for models aiming to grasp the complexities of the real world. Unlike text, which is inherently one-dimensional, the real-world environment exists in three dimensions. The use of one-dimensional position embeddings in current models significantly limits their ability to model three-dimensional space and temporal dynamics effectively. To bridge this gap, we have developed Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE), which employs separate components to represent temporal and spatial information. This enables the model to naturally comprehend dynamic content, such as videos or streaming data, improving its ability to understand and interact with the world.

Furthermore, compared to the scaling of large language models (LLMs), current LVLMs are still in the early stages of exploring the impact of scaling in terms of training data and model parameters. The exploration of scaling laws for LVLMs—how increases in model and data size affect performance—remains an open and promising area of research.

In this work, we introduce the newest addition to the large vision-language models of the Qwen family: Qwen2-VL series, which comprises three open-weight models
with total parameter counts of 2 billion, 8 billion, and 72 billion. As shown in Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution"), the key advances in Qwen2-VL include:

- —

  State-of-the-art understanding across various resolutions and aspect ratios: Qwen2-VL achieves leading performance on visual benchmarks, including DocVQA, InfoVQA, RealWorldQA, MTVQA, MathVista, and others.
- —

  Comprehension of extended-duration videos (20 min+): Qwen2-VL is capable of understanding videos over 20 minutes in length, enhancing its ability to perform high-quality video-based question answering, dialogue, content creation, and more.
- —

  Robust agent capabilities for device operation: With advanced reasoning and decision-making abilities, Qwen2-VL can be integrated with devices such as mobile phones, robots, etc., enabling autonomous operation based on visual inputs and text instructions.
- —

  Multilingual support: To serve a global audience, beyond English and Chinese, Qwen2-VL now supports multilingual context understanding within images, including most European languages, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Vietnamese, and others.

## Approach

The Qwen2-VL series consists of models of 3 sizes, which are Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B and Qwen2-VL-72B. Table [1](#S1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Introduction ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution") lists the hyper-parameters and important information.
Notably, Qwen2-VL employs a 675M parameter ViT across various-sized LLMs, ensuring that the computational load of the ViT remains constant regardless of the scale of the LLM.

### 2.1 Model Architecture

Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Introduction ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution") illustrates the comprehensive structure of Qwen2-VL. We have retained the Qwen-VL ([Bai et al., 2023b](#bib.bib11)) framework, which integrates vision encoders and language models.
For various scale adaptations, we have implemented a Vision Transformer (ViT) ([Dosovitskiy et al., 2021](#bib.bib26)) with approximately 675 million parameters, adept at handling both image and video inputs.
In terms of language processing, we have opted for the more powerful Qwen2 ([Yang et al., 2024](#bib.bib104)) series of language models.
To further enhance the model’s ability to effectively perceive and comprehend visual information in videos, we introduced several key upgrades:

##### Naive Dynamic Resolution

![Refer to caption](2409.12191v2/images/mrope.png)

Figure 3: A demonstration of M-RoPE. By decomposing rotary embedding into temporal, height, and width components, M-RoPE can explicitly model the positional information of text, images, and video in LLM.

A key architectural improvement in Qwen2-VL is the introduction of naive dynamic resolution support ([Dehghani et al., 2024](#bib.bib25)). Unlike Qwen-VL, Qwen2-VL can now process images of any resolution, dynamically converting them into a variable number of visual tokens.11
1
This technology was previously implemented in the internal iterations, Qwen-VL Plus and Qwen-VL MAX. We have further upgraded it in Qwen2-VL.
To support this feature, we modified ViT by removing the original absolute position embeddings and introducing 2D-RoPE ([Su et al., 2024](#bib.bib91); [Su, 2021](#bib.bib89)) to capture the two-dimensional positional information of images.
At the inference stage, images of varying resolutions are packed into a single sequence, with the packed length controlled to limit GPU memory usage.
Furthermore, to reduce the visual tokens of each image, a simple MLP layer is employed after the ViT to compress adjacent 2×22\times 2 tokens into a single token, with the special ¡—vision_start—¿ and ¡—vision_end—¿ tokens placed at the beginning and end of the compressed visual tokens.
As a result, an image with a resolution of 224×224224\times 224, encoded with a ViT using patch_size=14, will be compressed to 66 tokens before entering LLM.

##### Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE)

Another key architectural enhancement is the innovation of Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE).
Unlike the traditional 1D-RoPE in LLMs, which is limited to encoding one-dimensional positional information, M-RoPE effectively models the positional information of multimodal inputs.
This is achieved by deconstructing the original rotary embedding into three components: temporal, height, and width.
For text inputs, these components utilize identical position IDs, making M-RoPE functionally equivalent to 1D-RoPE ([Su, 2024](#bib.bib90)).
When processing images, the temporal IDs of each visual token remain constant, while distinct IDs are assigned to the height and width components based on the token’s position in the image.
For videos, which are treated as sequences of frames, the temporal ID increments for each frame, while the height and width components follow the same ID assignment pattern as images.
In scenarios where the model’s input encompasses multiple modalities, position numbering for each modality is initialized by incrementing the maximum position ID of the preceding modality by one.
An illustration of M-RoPE is shown in Figure [3](#S2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ Naive Dynamic Resolution ‣ 2.1 Model Architecture ‣ Approach ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution").
M-RoPE not only enhances the modeling of positional information but also reduces the value of position IDs for images and videos, enabling the model to extrapolate to longer sequences during inference.

##### Unified Image and Video Understanding

Qwen2-VL employs a mixed training regimen incorporating both image and video data, ensuring proficiency in image understanding and video comprehension.
To preserve video information as completely as possible, we sampled each video at two frames per second.
Additionally, we integrated 3D convolutions ([Carreira and Zisserman, 2017](#bib.bib12)) with a depth of two to process video inputs, allowing the model to handle 3D tubes instead of 2D patches, thus enabling it to process more video frames without increasing the sequence length ([Arnab et al., 2021](#bib.bib8)).
For consistency, each image is treated as two identical frames.
To balance the computational demands of long video processing with overall training efficiency, we dynamically adjust the resolution of each video frame, limiting the total number of tokens per video to 16384.
This training approach strikes a balance between the model’s ability to comprehend long videos and training efficiency.

### 2.2 Training

Following Qwen-VL ([Bai et al., 2023b](#bib.bib11)), we adopt a three-stage training methodology. In the first stage, we focus exclusively on training the Vision Transformer (ViT) component, utilizing a vast corpus of image-text pairs to enhance semantic understanding within the Large Language Model (LLM). In the second stage, we unfreeze all parameters and train with a wider range of data for more comprehensive learning. In the final stage, we lock the ViT parameters and perform exclusive fine-tuning of the LLM using instructional datasets.

The model is pre-trained on a diverse dataset that includes image-text pairs, optical character recognition (OCR) data, interleaved image-text articles, visual question answering datasets, video dialogues, and image knowledge datasets. Our data sources primarily comprise cleaned web pages, open-source datasets, and synthetic data. The cutoff date for our data knowledge is June 2023. This diverse data composition is instrumental in developing a robust multimodal understanding capability.

During the initial pre-training phase, Qwen2-VL is exposed to a corpus of around 600 billion tokens. The LLM component of Qwen2-VL is initialized using the parameters from Qwen2 ([Yang et al., 2024](#bib.bib104)), while the vision encoder of Qwen2-VL is initialized with the ViT derived from DFN. However, the fixed position embedding in the original DFN’s ViT ([Fang et al., 2023](#bib.bib28)) is replaced by RoPE-2D. This pre-training phase primarily focuses on learning image-text relationships, textual content recognition within images through OCR, and image classification tasks. Such foundational training is instrumental in enabling the model to develop a robust understanding of core visual-textual correlations and alignments.

The second pre-training phase marks a significant progression, involving an additional 800 billion tokens of image-related data. This stage introduces a higher volume of mixed image-text content, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between visual and textual information. The incorporation of visual question answering datasets refines the model’s capacity to respond to image-related queries. Moreover, the inclusion of multitasking datasets is pivotal in developing the model’s ability to navigate diverse tasks concurrently, a skill of paramount importance when dealing with complex, real-world datasets. Concurrently, purely textual data continues to play a crucial role in maintaining and advancing the model’s linguistic proficiency.

Throughout the pre-training stages, Qwen2-VL processes a cumulative total of 1.4 trillion tokens. Specifically, these tokens encompass not only text tokens but also image tokens. During the training process, however, we only provide supervision for the text tokens. This exposure to extensive and diverse linguistic and visual scenarios ensures that the model develops a deep understanding of the intricate relationships between visual and textual information, thereby laying a robust foundation for various multimodal tasks.

During the instruction fine-tuning phase, we employ the ChatML ([Openai, 2024](#bib.bib72)) format to construct instruction-following data. This dataset encompasses not only pure text-based dialogue data but also multimodal conversational data. The multimodal components include image question-answering, document parsing, multi-image comparison, video comprehension, video stream dialogue, and agent-based interactions. Our comprehensive approach to data construction aims to enhance the model’s capability to understand and execute a wide range of instructions across various modalities. By incorporating diverse data types, we seek to develop a more versatile and robust language model capable of handling complex, multimodal tasks in addition to traditional text-based interactions.

#### 2.2.1 Data Format.

In line with Qwen-VL, Qwen2-VL also employs special tokens to distinguish vision and text inputs. Tokens ¡—vision_start—¿ and ¡—vision_end—¿ are inserted at the start and end of the image feature sequence to demarcate the image content.

##### Dialogue Data.

In terms of dialogue format, we construct our instruction tuning dataset using the ChatML format, where each interaction’s statement is marked with two special tokens (¡—im_start—¿ and ¡—im_end—¿) to facilitate dialogue termination. The sections marked in blue indicate the supervised parts.

The Dataset Format Example of ChatML

¡—im_start—¿user
¡—vision_start—¿Picture1.jpg¡—vision_end—¿¡—vision_start—¿Picture2.jpg¡—vision_end—¿What do the two pictures have in common?¡—im_end—¿
¡—im_start—¿assistant
Both pictures are of SpongeBob SquarePants. ¡—im_end—¿
¡—im_start—¿user
What is happening in the video?¡—vision_start—¿video.mp4¡—vision_end—¿¡—im_end—¿
¡—im_start—¿assistant
The protagonist in the video is frying an egg.¡—im_end—¿

##### Visual Grounding.

To endow the model with visual grounding capabilities, bounding box coordinates are normalized within [0, 1000) and represented as ”(Xtop left,Ytop left),(Xbottom right,Ybottom right)(X_{\text{top left}},Y_{\text{top left}}),(X_{\text{bottom right}},Y_{\text{bottom right}})”.
Tokens ¡—box_start—¿ and ¡—box_end—¿ are utilized to demarcate bounding box text. To accurately link bounding boxes with their textual descriptions, we introduce tokens ¡—object_ref_start—¿ and ¡—object_ref_end—¿ to indicate the content that the bounding box references, thereby allowing the model to effectively interpret and generate precise descriptions of specific regions.

Referring Grounding

¡—vision_start—¿Picture1.jpg¡—vision_end—¿
¡—object_ref_start—¿the eyes on a giraffe¡—object_ref_end—¿¡—box_start—¿(176,106),(232,160) ¡—box_end—¿

##### Visual Agent.

To develop Qwen2-VL as a general-purpose VL-Agent, we treat various agent tasks, such as UI Operations, Robotic Control, Games, and Navigation, as sequential decision-making problems, enabling Qwen2-VL to accomplish tasks through multi-step action execution. For each task, we first define a set of permissible actions and keywords pattern (underline) for function call ([Qwen Team, 2024](#bib.bib77)). Qwen2-VL then analyzes the observations, performs reasoning and planning, executes the selected actions, and interacts with the environment to acquire new observations. This cycle repeats iteratively until the task is successfully completed. By integrating various tools and leveraging the vision perception capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), Qwen2-VL is able to iteratively execute increasingly complex tasks involving real-world visual interactions.

### 2.3 Multimodal Model Infrastructure

The Qwen2-VL models were trained on Alibaba Cloud’s PAI-Lingjun Intelligent Computing Service ([Alibaba-Cloud, 2024c](#bib.bib4)) with its scalable computing, auto resuming and straggler detection.

##### Storage.

We use Alibaba Cloud’s ultra-speed CPFS (Cloud Parallel File Storage) ([Alibaba-Cloud, 2024a](#bib.bib2)) to build a storage system of Qwen2-VL pre-training and post-training. We decoupled the text data and vision data storage. We simply store text data on CPFS and use mmap for efficient access. For vision data, we use Alibaba Cloud’s OSS (Object Storage Service) ([Alibaba-Cloud, 2024b](#bib.bib3)) for persistent storage. During training, we accessed vision data through OSS’s python-client concurrently and tuned the concurrency and retrying parameters to avoid reaching the QPS (queries per second) limit. We also found that video data decoding is a main bottleneck, especially for long videos. After several attempts with open-source ([FFmpeg-Developers, 2024](#bib.bib29)) and in-house software failed, we opted for a caching decoding technique. Checkpointing saves each GPU’s optimizer and model states on CPFS.

##### Parallelism.

We use 3D parallelism which combines data parallelism (DP) ([Li et al., 2020](#bib.bib50)), tensor parallelism (TP) ([Krizhevsky et al., 2012](#bib.bib44); [Shoeybi et al., 2019](#bib.bib83)) and pipeline parallelism (PP) ([Huang et al., 2019](#bib.bib36); [Narayanan et al., 2021](#bib.bib67); [Lamy-Poirier, 2023](#bib.bib45)) to scale Qwen2-VL model training. We also leverage deepspeed’s zero-1 redundancy optimizer ([Rajbhandari et al., 2020](#bib.bib79)) to shard states for memory saving. Sequence parallelism (SP) ([Korthikanti et al., 2023](#bib.bib43)) with selective checkpointing activation ([Chen et al., 2016](#bib.bib17)) was leveraged to reduce memory usage. When enabling TP training, we always shard the vision encoder and large language models together but not the vision merger due to its relatively few parameters. We found the TP training would result in different model shared-weights due to the convolution operator’s non-deterministic behavior 22
2
<https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html>. We resolved this issue by performing offline reduction of the shared weights, thereby avoiding an additional all-reduce communication step. This approach resulted in only a minimal impact on performance. We leverage 1F1B PP ([Narayanan et al., 2021](#bib.bib67)) for Qwen2-VL 72B training. We combine the vision encoder, vision adapter and several LLM’s decoder layers into one stage, and evenly split the remaining decoder layers. Note that the vision and text sequence lengths are dynamic for each data point. We broadcast the dynamic sequence lengths before initiating the 1F1B process and access the shape information using batch indices. We also implemented an interleaved 1F1B PP ([Narayanan et al., 2021](#bib.bib67)) but found it is slower than the standard 1F1B setting.

##### Software.

We use PyTorch ([Paszke et al., 2019](#bib.bib74); [Ansel et al., 2024](#bib.bib6)) version 2.1.2 with CUDA 11.8 ([Nvidia, 2024b](#bib.bib69)) for training. Additionally, we leverage flash-attention ([Dao et al., 2022](#bib.bib24); [Dao, 2024](#bib.bib23); [Shah et al., 2024](#bib.bib82)) for efficient training in both the vision encoder and the LLM. We also utilize fused operators ([Nvidia, 2024a](#bib.bib68)) such as LayerNorm ([Ba et al., 2016](#bib.bib9)), RMSNorm ([Zhang and Sennrich, 2019](#bib.bib115)), and Adam ([Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019](#bib.bib58)). Besides this, we leverage the overlap of communication and computation during matrix multiplication in our training process.

## Experiments

In this section, we first evaluate the model’s performance by conducting a comparative analysis across a variety of visual benchmarks, demonstrating the advantages of our approach. Subsequently, we carry out a detailed examination of specific capabilities, including general visual perception, document understanding, multilingual recognition in images, video comprehension, and agent abilities. Finally, we present an ablation study to investigate several key components of our approach.

### 3.1 Compare to SOTAs

We evaluate the visual capabilities of our model through various visual benchmarks, video tasks, and agent-based assessments. Qwen2-VL demonstrates highly competitive performance at the same scale, achieving new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. Overall, our 72B model consistently delivers top-tier performance across most evaluation metrics, frequently surpassing even closed-source models such as GPT-4o ([OpenAI, 2024](#bib.bib73)) and Claude 3.5-Sonnet ([Anthropic, 2024](#bib.bib7)). Notably, it exhibits a significant advantage in document understanding tasks. However, in the MMMU ([Yue et al., 2023](#bib.bib111)) benchmark, our model still lags behind GPT-4o to some extent, indicating that Qwen2-VL-72B has room for improvement when handling more complex and challenging problem sets.

### 3.2 Quantitative Results

In this section, we present an extensive evaluation of the Qwen2-VL series across an array of datasets, offering a comprehensive understanding of the model’s capabilities in various aspects.

#### 3.2.1 General Visual Question Answering

To rigorously assess our models’ capabilities in general visual question answering tasks, we conduct extensive evaluations across a diverse array of state-of-the-art benchmarks: RealWorldQA ([X.AI, 2024a](#bib.bib100)), MMStar ([Chen et al., 2024a](#bib.bib15)), MMVet ([Yu et al., 2024](#bib.bib110)), MMT-Bench ([Ying et al., 2024](#bib.bib109)), MMBench ([Liu et al., 2023d](#bib.bib56)), MMbench-1.1 ([Liu et al., 2023d](#bib.bib56)), MME ([Fu et al., 2023](#bib.bib30)), and HallusionBench ([Guan et al., 2023](#bib.bib32)). The Qwen2-VL series exhibits exceptional performance across these benchmarks, with the 72B model consistently achieving or surpassing state-of-the-art results, while the 7B and 2B variants also demonstrate robust capabilities. On RealWorldQA, which evaluates real-world spatial comprehension, Qwen2-VL-72B achieves a score of 77.8, surpassing both the previous state-of-the-art (72.2) and formidable baselines such as GPT-4o (75.4), thus demonstrating superior understanding of physical environments. For MMStar, a benchmark designed to assess genuine multimodal capabilities through visually indispensable samples, Qwen2-VL-72B attains 68.3, outperforming the previous best of 67.1 and highlighting its proficiency in integrating visual and textual information. On MMVet, which evaluates the integration of core vision-language capabilities across 16 complex multimodal tasks, Qwen2-VL-72B achieves a remarkable 74.0, significantly outperforming strong competitors including GPT-4V (67.5) and showcasing its versatility in addressing diverse multimodal challenges. In the MMT-Bench evaluation, which assesses advanced reasoning and instruction following across 32 core meta-tasks and 162 subtasks in multimodal understanding, Qwen2-VL-72B achieves 71.7, markedly surpassing the previous best (63.4) and demonstrating its prowess in applying expert knowledge and executing deliberate visual recognition, localization, reasoning, and planning. On MMBench, which evaluates fine-grained abilities across 20 dimensions, Qwen2-VL-72B exhibits strong performance, achieving 86.5 on the English test set, matching the state-of-the-art, and 86.6 on the Chinese test set, establishing a new benchmark. For MME, which measures a wide spectrum of perception and cognition abilities across 14 subtasks, Qwen2-VL-72B achieves a cumulative score of 2482.7, significantly outperforming the previous best (2414.7), underscoring its advanced capabilities in both visual perception and high-level cognition tasks.

These comprehensive results underscore the Qwen2-VL series’ exceptional proficiency in general visual question answering tasks. The models demonstrate advanced capabilities in real-world spatial comprehension, genuine multimodal integration, complex reasoning, instruction following, and a broad range of perception and cognition tasks. The consistent superior performance across diverse benchmarks, particularly the outstanding results of the 72B model, positions the Qwen2-VL series as a leading solution in the field of visual question answering. Our models excel in handling visually indispensable tasks, integrating core vision-language capabilities, and demonstrating expertise across diverse multimodal scenarios, ranging from fundamental perception tasks to complex reasoning and planning. This exhaustive evaluation highlights the Qwen2-VL series’ versatility and effectiveness in addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by state-of-the-art multimodal benchmarks, thereby setting a new standard for large vision-language models.

#### 3.2.2 Document and Diagrams Reading

We tested our model’s OCR and document and diagram comprehension on DocVQA ([Mathew et al., 2021](#bib.bib66)), ChartQA ([Masry et al., 2022](#bib.bib65)),InfoVQA ([Mathew et al., 2021](#bib.bib66)), TextVQA ([Singh et al., 2019](#bib.bib87)),AI2D ([Kembhavi et al., 2016](#bib.bib40)) datasets. The DocVQA/InfoVQA/ChartQA dataset focuses on the model’s ability to comprehend text in documents/high-resolution infographics/charts, while the TextVQA dataset examines the ability to comprehend text in naturalistic images. The OCRBench dataset is a a dataset of mixed tasks, which focuses on mathematical formula parsing and information extraction in addition to the text-based VQA. The AI2D dataset focuses on multiple-choice questions on scientific diagrams containing text. In addition, we also tested the OCR and formula recognition capabilities of our model on OCRBench ([Liu et al., 2023e](#bib.bib57)), as well as the multilingual OCR capabilities of our model on the MTVQA ([Tang et al., 2024](#bib.bib92)) dataset.

The experimental results show that our model achieves SoTA level in several metrics, including DocVQA, InfoVQA, TextVQA and OCRBench, demonstrating that our model has good comprehension of textual content in images from multiple domains.

#### 3.2.3 Multilingual Text Recognition and Understanding

In particular, our model surpasses all existing general-purpose LVLMs in multilingual OCR. Our model not only outperforms existing LVLMs (including proprietary models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.) on the public-available MTVQA dataset, it also outperforms GPT-4o on the in-house internal benchmark across all foreign languages except Arabic (Table [3](#S3.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Experiments ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution")).

#### 3.2.4 Mathematical Reasoning

We’ve conducted experiments on the MathVista ([Lu et al., 2024a](#bib.bib61)) and MathVision ([Wang et al., 2024](#bib.bib96)) datasets to assess mathematical reasoning capabilities. MathVista is a comprehensive benchmark featuring 6,141 diverse examples of mathematical and visual tasks. The MathVision dataset comprises 3,040 math problems embedded in visual contexts from actual math competitions, covering 16 mathematical disciplines and varying in difficulty across five levels. These challenges underscore the necessity for LVLMs to exhibit strong visual comprehension, a deep understanding of mathematics, and sound logical reasoning skills. The Qwen2-VL series has demonstrated superior performance on MathVista, achieving a 70.5 outperforming other LVLMs. Additionally, it has set a new open-source benchmark on MathVision with 25.9.

#### 3.2.5 Referring Expression Comprehension

Regarding visual localization task, we evaluate Qwen2-VL on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg datasets ([Kazemzadeh et al., 2014](#bib.bib39); [Mao et al., 2016](#bib.bib64)). The results, as depicted in Table [6](#S3.T6 "Table 6 ‣ 3.2.5 Referring Expression Comprehension ‣ 3.2 Quantitative Results ‣ Experiments ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution"), demonstrate that Qwen2-VL attains top-tier results among generalist models. Benefiting from a more rational structure design, Qwen2-VL is able to perceive details in high-resolution images, leading to significant improvements over Qwen-VL.
The superiority of these models in comparison to both generalist and specialized models highlights their potential for advancing the field of visual localization and their capacity for real-world implementation in tasks requiring precise visual understanding.

#### 3.2.6 Video Understanding

We evaluate our models on various video understanding tasks, with related benchmarks covering short videos of a few seconds to long videos of up to one hour. Table [4](#S3.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Experiments ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution") presents the performance of Qwen2-VL and baseline models.
Overall, Qwen2-VL demonstrates strong results across 2B, 7B, and 72B sizes, with Qwen2-VL-72B achieving the best performance on MVBench ([Li et al., 2024](#bib.bib49)), PerceptionTest ([Patraucean et al., 2024](#bib.bib75)), and EgoSchema ([Mangalam et al., 2023](#bib.bib63)).
This showcases Qwen2-VL’s superior capabilities in video understanding tasks, and scaling up Qwen2-VL yields significant improvements.
For the challenging Video-MME benchmark ([Fu et al., 2024](#bib.bib31)), which includes videos up to one hour, it is noteworthy that we limited the maximum number of frames extracted per video to 768 during evaluation, potentially impacting performance on longer videos.
Future work will focus on extending Qwen2-VL to support longer sequences, thereby accommodating longer videos.

#### 3.2.7 Visual Agent

Qwen2-VL is evaluated first for its ability to interact with the environment via function calls and then for its capacity to complete complex sequential decision tasks through multiple rounds of interaction. The implementation is based on the Qwen-Agent framework ([Qwen Team, 2024](#bib.bib77)).

##### Function Calling

Unlike function calling in LLMs ([Yan et al., 2024](#bib.bib103); [Srinivasan et al., 2023](#bib.bib88); [Chen et al., 2023c](#bib.bib18)), function calling in LVLMs often involves extracting information from visual cues. Due to the absence of public benchmarks for evaluating the capabilities of LVLMs in function calling, we constructed our internal evaluation dataset.

To construct the evaluation dataset, we undertook the following procedures ([Chen et al., 2023c](#bib.bib18)): Scene Categorization, Image Collection, Image Content Extraction, and Question/Functions/Arguments Generation. Firstly, we classified scenes into categories based on different visual applications. Subsequently, we downloaded and meticulously selected high-quality, representative images from the internet for each category. Thereafter, utilizing an advanced LVLM ([Bai et al., 2023b](#bib.bib11)), we analyzed each image to extract key visual elements and textual information. Finally, based on the content information from the images, we used an advanced LLM ([Yang et al., 2024](#bib.bib104)) to generate a series of questions that required specific functions to answer, along with specifying the input parameters needed for these function calls.

Similar to the function calling evaluation method in LLMs ([Yan et al., 2024](#bib.bib103)), we designed two metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the function selection and the correctness of the arguments input. Specifically, Type Match(TM), is calculated as the ratio of times the model successfully invoked the correct function to the total number of calls attempted. Exact Match(EM), for each function calling, we checked whether the arguments passed to the function exactly matched those recorded in the image’s content information, calculating this correctness ratio.

As shown in Table [5](#S3.T5 "Table 5 ‣ Experiments ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution"), the performance of Qwen2-VL in both Type Match(93.1 vs. 90.2) and Exact Match(53.2 vs. 50.0) over GPT-4o substantiates the efficacy of Qwen2-VL’s capability in function calling, thereby underscoring its significant potential for application expansion through external tool integration.

The evaluation results demonstrated that GPT-4o underperformed, primarily due to two factors: in scenarios where uncertainty arises, GPT-4o demonstrates a conservative approach by avoiding using external tools. The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of GPT-4o is outperformed by Qwen2-VL, particularly in the context of Chinese characters.

##### UI Operations/Games/Robotics/Navigation

To assess Qwen2-VL’s ability to generally handle complex tasks, we conduct evaluations across multiple VL agent tasks, including mobile operations ([Zhang et al., 2024b](#bib.bib117); [Rawles et al., 2024b](#bib.bib81); [Lu et al., 2024b](#bib.bib62); [Rawles et al., 2024a](#bib.bib80)), robotic control ([Kolve et al., 2017](#bib.bib42); [Shridhar et al., 2020a](#bib.bib84); [Inoue and Ohashi, 2022](#bib.bib37); [Lu et al., 2023](#bib.bib59); [Jiang et al., 2022](#bib.bib38); [Huang et al., 2023b](#bib.bib35)), card games ([Zhai et al., 2024](#bib.bib113)), and vision-language navigation ([Anderson et al., 2018](#bib.bib5); [Qi et al., 2020](#bib.bib76)). As these tasks need multiple actions to complete tasks, we keep the history (observation, action) through Qwen2-VL supports a 32K context length, then append each new observation image after every action, enabling continuous reasoning about subsequent steps.

UI Operations: we evaluate Qwen2-VL using the AITZ task ([Zhang et al., 2024b](#bib.bib117)), which constructs a core clean test set derived from AITW ([Rawles et al., 2024b](#bib.bib81)). Based on common operation patterns of phone, we define actions such as tap, input and swipe ([Rawles et al., 2024b](#bib.bib81)) for Qwen2-VL to interact with on-screen icons for task completion. For example, when Qwen2-VL is tasked with finding a pizza restaurant nearby by Google Maps, it should input ”pizza” in the search term, swipe to select the appropriate restaurant, and tap the corresponding link. Following the AITZ setting, we report both type match (correctness of tap, input, or swipe) and exact match (correctness of tap location, input text, or swipe direction). With the support of grounding capability on UI, Qwen2-VL surpasses GPT-4 and previous SoTA ([Zhang et al., 2024b](#bib.bib117); [Zhan and Zhang, 2023](#bib.bib114)).

Robotic Control: we evaluate Qwen2-VL on the ALFRED task ([Shridhar et al., 2020a](#bib.bib84)) in AI2THOR ([Kolve et al., 2017](#bib.bib42)). The task requires agent to perform complex household tasks, such as toasting bread and slicing an apple to prepare a meal. To work in the virtual environment, we define high-level actions (GotoLocation, Pickup, PutDown, Open, Close, Clean, Heat, Cool, Slice) ([Shridhar et al., 2020b](#bib.bib85)) as the action set. Moreover, agent needs to localize objects for manipulation (e.g., it can only pick up an apple if the apple is recognized). To improve the accuracy of manipulation, we integrate SAM ([Kirillov et al., 2023](#bib.bib41)). ALFRED task reports task success rate (SR) (e.g., preparing dinner) and sub-goal completion metrics (GC) (e.g., whether the bread is toasted or the apple is sliced). Qwen2-VL slightly outperforms the previously specialized model ThinkBot ([Lu et al., 2023](#bib.bib59)) on the valid-unseen set.

Card Games: we leverage the card game environment from RL4VLM ([Zhai et al., 2024](#bib.bib113)) to assess Qwen2-VL’s performance in a series of card-based games: Number Line, BlackJack, EZPoint, and Point24. Each game presents distinct challenges: (1) reaching a target number using +1 or -1 operations, (2) drawing or holding cards to compete against the dealer, (3) applying basic arithmetic operations to reach a total of 12, and (4) using arithmetic operations to achieve a total of 24. We report the success rate of the tasks. They not only evaluate agent capabilities but also require strong OCR skills to recognize these cards and understand the progression of the game. Qwen2-VL demonstrates superior performance across all tasks.

Vision-Language Navigation: we evaluate Qwen2-VL on the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task using the R2R ([Anderson et al., 2018](#bib.bib5)) and REVERIE ([Qi et al., 2020](#bib.bib76)). In VLN, the model must autonomously determine the next location based on instruction, current observations. We report the success rate (SR) of VLM in reaching the predetermined destination for this task. The performance of Qwen2-VL is comparable to that of GPT-4o, but both models fall significantly behind current specialized VLN models ([Chen et al., 2022](#bib.bib16); [Sigurdsson et al., 2023](#bib.bib86)). We attribute this gap to the incomplete and unstructured map information generated by the model from multiple images. Accurately modeling maps and locations in a 3D environment remains a major challenge for multimodal models.

### 3.3 Ablation Study

In this section, we present ablation studies on image dynamic resolution, M-RoPE, and model scale. These experiments aim to provide insights into the impact of these key components on our model’s performance.

#### 3.3.1 Dynamic Resolution

Table 7: Qwen2-VL-7B under fixed/dynamic image tokens. Adjusting image sizes only results in small perturbations in performance, demonstrating the robustness to varying image sizes. Moreover, the dynamic resolution strategy achieves top-tier performance while consuming fewer tokens on average, demonstrating the efficiency of our model.

Figure 4: Qwen2-VL-7B with different min_pixels. Small images are upscaled to surpass a specified min_pixels threshold before input into the model. Increasing the image size within a reasonable range shows enhanced performance on perceptual tasks like InfoVQA, HallusionBench, and OCRBench.

As shown in Table [7](#S3.T7 "Table 7 ‣ 3.3.1 Dynamic Resolution ‣ 3.3 Ablation Study ‣ Experiments ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution"), we compare the performance between dynamic resolution and fixed resolution. For fixed resolution, we resize the images to ensure a constant number of image tokens being input to the model, rather than resizing to a specific height and width, as this would distort the original aspect ratio. For dynamic resolution, we only set min_pixels=100×28×28=100\times 28\times 28 and max_pixels=16384×28×28=16384\times 28\times 28, allowing the number of image tokens depend primarily on the image’s native resolution. It can be observed that adjusting image sizes only results in small perturbations in performance, demonstrating the model robustness to varying image sizes. Moreover, dynamic resolution approach is more efficient. We can observe that no single fixed resolution achieves optimal performance across all benchmarks. In contrast, the dynamic resolution approach consistently achieves top-tier performance while consuming fewer tokens on average.

Additionally, we observe that merely increasing the image size does not always lead to improved performance. It is more important to choose an appropriate resolution for different images. As detailed in Figure [4](#S3.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 3.3.1 Dynamic Resolution ‣ 3.3 Ablation Study ‣ Experiments ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution"), we upscale small images to surpass a specified min_pixels threshold. Evaluations on upscaled images shows enhanced performance on perceptual tasks like InfoVQA, HallusionBench, and OCRBench. We attribute these gains to increased computational load. However, for OCRBench, a too-high min_pixels value leads to a severe performance decline. This is likely because OCRBench contains numerous extremely small images, and excessive enlargement causes these images to deviate from the training data distribution, turning them into out-of-distribution samples. In contrast, the effect of increasing min_pixels on the MMMU benchmark is negligible. We hypothesize that the performance bottleneck in MMMU is more related to the model’s reasoning capability rather than image resolution.

#### 3.3.2 M-RoPE

Table 8: Ablation studies of M-RoPE. Compared to 1D-RoPE, using M-RoPE achieves better performance in downstream tasks, particularly in video benchmarks. RWQ means RealworldQA.

Figure 5: Evaluate the length extrapolation capability of Qwen2-VL-72B on Video-MME Medium Video. With the help of M-RoPE, the model demonstrated robust performance when the inference length exceeded the maximum training length of 16384 tokens.

In this subsection, we demonstrate the effectiveness of M-RoPE. First, we validate its capability on various downstream tasks. We employ Qwen2-1.5B and ViT-L as the backbone and report the results of the pre-trained models. As shown in Table [8](#S3.T8 "Table 8 ‣ 3.3.2 M-RoPE ‣ 3.3 Ablation Study ‣ Experiments ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution"), compared to 1D-RoPE, using M-RoPE achieves better performance in downstream tasks, particularly in video benchmarks. Furthermore, we assess the length extrapolation capability of M-RoPE on Video-MME medium-length videos. Figure [5](#S3.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 3.3.2 M-RoPE ‣ 3.3 Ablation Study ‣ Experiments ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution") illustrates the performance of Qwen2-VL-72B at different inference lengths. Leveraging M-RoPE, the model demonstrates robust results across various inference lengths. Notably, despite limiting the maximum tokens per video to 16K during training, the model still exhibits exceptional performance at a maximum inference length of 80K tokens.

#### 3.3.3 Model Scaling

![Refer to caption](2409.12191v2/images/scale.jpg)

Figure 6: Model Performance Scaling Across Capabilities and Training Progress. As model size and the volume of training data increase, performance consistently improves across a range of capabilities and benchmarks.

We evaluate the performance of models of varying scales across multiple capability dimensions. Specifically, we categorize these dimensions into complex college-level problem-solving, mathematical abilities, document and table comprehension, general scenario question-answering, and video comprehension. The overall capability of a model is assessed by averaging its scores across different benchmarks associated with each dimension.

In particular, we use the MMMU ([Yue et al., 2023](#bib.bib111)) benchmark to represent college-level problem-solving ability, while the average scores from MathVista ([Lu et al., 2024a](#bib.bib61)) and MathVision ([Wang et al., 2024](#bib.bib96)) serve as indicators of mathematical ability. For general scenario question-answering, we compute the average score across the RealWorldQA ([X.AI, 2024a](#bib.bib100)), MMBench-V1.1 ([Liu et al., 2023d](#bib.bib56)), MMT-Bench ([Ying et al., 2024](#bib.bib109)), HallBench ([Guan et al., 2023](#bib.bib32)), MMVet ([Yu et al., 2024](#bib.bib110)), and MMStar ([Chen et al., 2024a](#bib.bib15)) benchmarks. Document and table comprehension capability is reflected through the average score from benchmarks like DocVQA ([Mathew et al., 2021](#bib.bib66)), InfoVQA ([Mathew et al., 2021](#bib.bib66)), ChartQA ([Masry et al., 2022](#bib.bib65)), TextVQA ([Singh et al., 2019](#bib.bib87)), OCRBench ([Liu et al., 2023e](#bib.bib57)), and MTVQA ([Tang et al., 2024](#bib.bib92)). Lastly, video comprehension ability is measured by averaging scores across MVBench ([Li et al., 2024](#bib.bib49)), PerceptionTest ([Patraucean et al., 2024](#bib.bib75)), EgoSchema ([Mangalam et al., 2023](#bib.bib63)), and Video-MME ([Fu et al., 2024](#bib.bib31)).

As illustrated in Figure [6](#S3.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 3.3.3 Model Scaling ‣ 3.3 Ablation Study ‣ Experiments ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution")(a), there is a consistent improvement in performance with increasing model size, particularly with respect to mathematical abilities, which show a positive correlation with the number of model parameters. On the other hand, for optical character recognition (OCR)-related tasks, even smaller-scale models exhibit relatively strong performance.

As shown in Figure [6](#S3.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 3.3.3 Model Scaling ‣ 3.3 Ablation Study ‣ Experiments ‣ Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model’s Perception of the World at Any Resolution")(b), we visualize the relationship between model performance and the number of training tokens during the second stage of pretraining for Qwen2-VL-7B. As the number of training tokens increases, the model performance improves; however, performance on vision question answering (VQA) tasks exhibits some fluctuation. In contrast, for tasks such as AI2D ([Kembhavi et al., 2016](#bib.bib40)) and InfoVQA ([Mathew et al., 2021](#bib.bib66))—both of which involve understanding textual and graphical information in images—the model performance shows steady improvement as training data is augmented.

## Conclusion

We have presented the Qwen2-VL series, the versatile large vision-language models, including three open-weight models with total parameter counts of 2, 8, and 72 billion. Qwen2-VL matches the performance of top-tier models like GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet in a range of multimodal scenarios, surpassing all other open-weight LVLM models. Qwen2-VL series introduces naive dynamic resolution and multimodal rotary position embedding (M-RoPE) to fuse information across modals effectively and be capable of understanding videos over 20 minutes in length. With advanced reasoning and decision-making abilities, Qwen2-VL can be integrated with devices such as mobile phones, robots, etc. Furthermore, Qwen2-VL now supports understanding multilingual texts within images, including most European languages, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Vietnamese, and others.

We have made the Qwen2-VL model weights openly accessible, which enables researchers and developers to harness the full potential in a variety of applications and research projects. We aim to advance AI technologies and enhance their beneficial effects on society by dedicating ourselves to these endeavors.

## Appendix A Model Capabilities and Qualitative Examples

In this section, we present some practical examples of our Qwen2-VL.

### A.1 General Chat and OCR

The Qwen2-VL models are now more adept at accurately describing and identifying complex information within images, as well as providing detailed background and answering related questions. Besides, the text processing capabilities of the Qwen2-VL models have seen significant improvements, particularly concerning the recognition of Chinese and English text within images.

Model Response

The image shows a stack of colorful blocks with numbers on them. Here is the color and number of each block from top to bottom:
- Top row (single block): Blue with the number 9
- Second row (two blocks): Light blue with the number 7, and green with the number 8
- Third row (three blocks): Purple with the number 4, pink with the number 5, and light green with the number 6
- Bottom row (four blocks): Red with the number 0, orange with the number 1, yellow with the number 2, and light green with the number 3

Figure 7: When presented with an image of cubes of different colors, the models identify their layout and the color of each cube.

1. If i>0i>0, let d¯′′:=(i−1,d−i−l+1,l)\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}:=(i-1,d-i-l+1,l). Let Vd¯V_{\underline{d}} and Vd¯′′V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}} be r+1r+1-dimensional subspaces of H0​(ℒd¯)H^{0}(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}}) and H0​(ℒd¯′′)H^{0}(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}}), respectively, such that φd¯,d¯′′​(Vd¯)=Vd¯′′X1,0\varphi_{\underline{d},\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}}(V_{\underline{d}})=V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}}^{X_{1},0}. Then the distributivity holds in Vd¯′′V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}} if and only if

dim(Vd¯X2,0+Vd¯X3,0)−dim(Vd¯′′X2,0+Vd¯′′X3,0)=r+1−dim(Vd¯′′X1,0+Vd¯′′X2,0+Vd¯′′X3,0)\dim(V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{2},0}+V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{3},0})-\dim(V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}}^{X_{2},0}+V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}}^{X_{3},0})=r+1-\dim(V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}}^{X_{1},0}+V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}}^{X_{2},0}+V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}}^{X_{3},0})
2. If i+l≤d−1i+l\leq d-1, let d¯′′′:=(i,d−i−l−1,l+1)\underline{d}^{\prime\prime\prime}:=(i,d-i-l-1,l+1). Let Vd¯V_{\underline{d}} and Vd¯′′′V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime\prime}} be r+1r+1-dimensional subspaces of H0​(ℒd¯)H^{0}(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}}) and H0​(ℒd¯′′′)H^{0}(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime\prime}}), respectively, such that φd¯′′′,d¯​(Vd¯′′′)=Vd¯X3,0\varphi_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime\prime},\underline{d}}(V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime\prime}})=V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{3},0}. Then the distributivity holds in Vd¯V_{\underline{d}} if and only if

dim(Vd¯′′′X1,0+Vd¯′′′X2,0)−dim(Vd¯X1,0+Vd¯X2,0)=r+1−dim(Vd¯X1,0+Vd¯X2,0+Vd¯X3,0),\dim(V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime\prime}}^{X_{1},0}+V_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime\prime}}^{X_{2},0})-\dim(V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{1},0}+V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{2},0})=r+1-\dim(V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{1},0}+V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{2},0}+V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{3},0}),
where the maps φd¯,d¯′′\varphi_{\underline{d},\underline{d}^{\prime\prime}} and φd¯′′′,d¯\varphi_{\underline{d}^{\prime\prime\prime},\underline{d}} in Proposition 3.14 are the maps linking the corresponding sheaves. Another important result is Proposition 3.16, which establishes an inequality for any exact limit linear series. Specifically, our Proposition 3.16 says:
Let {(ℒd¯,Vd¯)}d¯\{(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}},V_{\underline{d}})\}_{\underline{d}} be an exact limit linear series of degree dd and dimension rr. Then

∑d¯dim(Vd¯Vd¯X1,0+Vd¯X2,0+Vd¯X3,0)≥r+1.\sum_{\underline{d}}\dim\left(\frac{V_{\underline{d}}}{V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{1},0}+V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{2},0}+V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{3},0}}\right)\geq r+1.
As a consequence of Proposition 3.14 and Proposition 3.16, in Corollary 3.17, we get the following characterization of exact limit linear series satisfying the distributivity at each multidegree:
Let {(ℒd¯,Vd¯)}d¯\{(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}},V_{\underline{d}})\}_{\underline{d}} be an exact limit linear series of degree dd and dimension rr. Then

∑d¯dim(Vd¯Vd¯X1,0+Vd¯X2,0+Vd¯X3,0)=r+1\sum_{\underline{d}}\dim\left(\frac{V_{\underline{d}}}{V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{1},0}+V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{2},0}+V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{3},0}}\right)=r+1
if and only if the distributivity holds in Vd¯V_{\underline{d}} for any d¯\underline{d}.
In Section 3, we also study simple limit linear series. In Proposition 3.18, we characterize the multidegrees which determine all simple bases. In Proposition 3.20, following the construction in Muñoz [5], Proposition 4.4, we present a certain structure of linearly independent sections for any exact limit linear series satisfying the distributivity property. In propositions 3.21 and 3.22, we obtain some properties of that structure. These properties imply the existence of a simple basis (we give a proof of that in Proposition 3.23).
We conclude Section 3 with a characterization of simple limit linear series among the exact limit linear series. Specifically, our Corollary 3.24 says:
Let {(ℒd¯,Vd¯)}d¯\{(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}},V_{\underline{d}})\}_{\underline{d}} be an exact limit linear series of degree dd and dimension rr. Then the following statements are equivalent:
1. {(ℒd¯,Vd¯)}d¯\{(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}},V_{\underline{d}})\}_{\underline{d}} is simple.
2. ∑d¯dim(Vd¯Vd¯X1,0+Vd¯X2,0+Vd¯X3,0)=r+1\sum_{\underline{d}}\dim\left(\frac{V_{\underline{d}}}{V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{1},0}+V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{2},0}+V_{\underline{d}}^{X_{3},0}}\right)=r+1.
3. The distributivity holds in Vd¯V_{\underline{d}} for any d¯\underline{d}.
In a subsequent work, given a refined limit linear series, we will construct all simple extensions by combining our Proposition 3.14 and the method of Muñoz [6] for the construction of all exact extensions.

The text in the image reads:
Learning Prompt
Guo Moruo’s collection of poems, ”The Goddess”, is a representative work of modern Chinese poetry. It expresses new content and forms, embodying the spirit of the May Fourth Movement. ”Standing on the Edge of the Earth” is a representative poem from ”The Goddess”. The poet imagines standing on the edge of the earth to observe it from all angles, shouting and singing, imagining the surging clouds, magnificent Arctic ice, and violent Pacific Ocean, praising the power to destroy the old world and create a new life. This poem embodies the free, and bold spirit of the May Fourth Movement. When reading, pay attention to connecting with the specific context of the May Fourth Movement to understand the content and form of this poem.
  
Wen Yiduo’s ”Red Candle” uses the classical image of ”candle” to give it a new meaning, praising the red candle for its dedication to lighting up the world. Pay attention to how the poet uses the dialogue between ”red candle” and ”red candle” to express the confusion and hope of youth, as well as the firm pursuit of ideals. The use of fantasy and emotional rhetoric, the use of rhetorical devices such as alliteration and assonance, and the formation of rhythmic beauty through the arrangement of long and short sentences in the poem are also important aspects to appreciate.
  
Chang Yao’s ”Snow Capped Peak on the Side of the Sun” is rich in content. When reading, pay attention to the development of imagination and taste the heavy and majestic atmosphere created by the images of ”snow-capped peak”, ”sun”, and ”spider”. Feel the powerful contained in it.
  
Shelley’s ”To a Skylark” has profound implications and novel imagery. Pay attention to the poet’s emotions and understand the symbolic meaning of the skylark. Grasp the characteristics of the interlocking between sections of the work and appreciate the poet’s use of bold and flexible imagery.
  
When learning this group of poems, rely more on reading aloud to clarify the emotional context of the poem and grasp the connotation of the image. Feel the emotions expressed by the poet and understand the use of symbolism.

Mathematical Problem Solving
![Refer to caption](2409.12191v2/images/2-1-triangle.jpg)
Find the length of A​CAC in the isosceles triangle A​B​CABC.

Model Response

Since triangle A​B​CABC is isosceles, we know that A​C=B​CAC=BC. Therefore, we can set the expressions for A​CAC and B​CBC equal to each other and solve for xx
4​x+1=5​x−0.54x+1=5x-0.5
Subtracting 4​x4x from both sides, we get:
1=x−0.51=x-0.5
Adding 0.50.5 to both sides, we get:
1.5=x1.5=x
Now that we know the value of xx, we can substitute it back into the expression for A​CAC to find its length:
A​C=4​x+1AC=4x+1
A​C=4​(1.5)+1AC=4(1.5)+1
A​C=6+1AC=6+1
A​C=7AC=7
Therefore, the length of A​CAC is 77.

Read the image and solve it step by step.

Model Response

The image shows two geometric figures, a rectangular prism and a cube, with their dimensions labeled. The problem asks to calculate the surface area and volume of these figures.
  
1.For the rectangular prism:
Length (l) = 4 cm
Width (w) = 2 cm
Height (h) = 3 cm
Surface Area (SA) of a rectangular prism = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh
Volume (V) of a rectangular prism = lwh
Substituting the given values:
SA = 2(4cm)(2cm) + 2(4cm)(3cm) + 2(2cm)(3cm)
SA = 16cm² + 24cm² + 12cm² SA = 52cm²
V = (4cm)(2cm)(3cm) V = 24cm³
  
2.For the cube:
Side length (a) = 3 dm
Surface Area (SA) of a cube = 6a² Volume (V) of a cube = a³
Substituting the given value:
SA = 6(3dm)² SA = 6(9dm²) SA = 54dm²
V = (3dm)³ V = 27dm³
  
So, the surface area and volume for each figure are as follows:
For the rectangular prism:
Surface Area = 52 cm²
Volume = 24 cm³
  
For the cube:
Surface Area = 54 dm²
Volume = 27 dm³

Solve the algorithmic problem in the web page.

Model Response

To solve the “Snake in Matrix” problem, we need to implement a function that takes the size of the matrix nn and a list of commands, and returns the final position of the snake after executing all the commands. Here’s a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1.

Initialize Variables:

—

Initialize the current position of the snake as 00.
—

Initialize the direction of the snake as RIGHT (initially, the snake moves to the right).
2.

Define Movement Functions:

—

Create a function to move the snake based on the current direction and the size of the matrix nn.
—

Update the position of the snake accordingly.
3.

Process Commands:

—

Iterate through each command in the list of commands.
—

For each command, update the direction and position of the snake.
4.

Return Final Position:

—

After processing all commands, return the final position of the snake.
Here’s the Python code to implement the solution:

Please tell me how many days are between Ruka’s birthday and Yuki’s birthday? Think carefully step by step.

Model Response

To determine the number of days between Ruka’s and Yuki’s birthdays, we need to calculate the difference between their respective birth dates.

1.

Ruka’s birthday is on June 24.
2.

Yuki’s birthday is on September 17.
Let’s break it down step by step:

1.

From June 24 to June 30:

—

June 24 to June 30 is 6 days.
2.

From July 1 to August 31:

—

July has 31 days.
—

August has 31 days.
—

Total days in July and August: 31 + 31 = 62 days.
3.

From September 1 to September 17:

—

September 1 to September 17 is 17 days.
Now, we add all these days together:

—

June 24 to June 30: 6 days
—

July 1 to August 31: 62 days
—

September 1 to September 17: 17 days
Total days = 6 + 62 + 17 = 85 days
Therefore, there are 85 days between Ruka’s and Yuki’s birthdays.

Function Result

Finished execution.

Model Response

The code has been executed without any errors, which means that the structure of the code matches the flowchart and there are no syntax issues. However, since the functions are placeholders and do not perform any actual operations, we cannot validate the correctness of the implementation. The code simply represents the flowchart by defining each module as a function and demonstrating how the functions could be called in sequence to process input audio and produce output audio.

Figure 27: The model identified the steps in the flowchart, drafted the simulation code as required while omitting the details, and then successfully executed it through the code interpreter. Image source: ([Dubey et al., 2024](#bib.bib27))

31.451165958047895)

Model Response

The probabilities assigned to each expert based on the input vector (x) are: (p = [0.01165623, 0.03168492, 0.08612854, 0.23412166, 0.63640865]).
The top (k = 3) experts selected based on these probabilities are the experts with indices 4, 3, and 2 (in descending order of probability).
The output (y) computed as a weighted sum of the outputs of these top experts is approximately 31.4512.
This example demonstrates a simple implementation of the MoE model’s operation. In a real-world scenario, the gating network (GG) and the experts (EiE_{i}) would be more complex, involving neural network layers and potentially non-linear transformations.
