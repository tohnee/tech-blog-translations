## Introduction

**MiMo-V2.5-ASR** is a state-of-the-art end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) model developed by the Xiaomi MiMo team. It is built to deliver accurate and robust transcription across Mandarin Chinese and English, multiple Chinese dialects, code-switched speech, song lyrics, knowledge-intensive content, noisy acoustic environments, and multi-speaker conversations. MiMo-V2.5-ASR achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide range of public benchmarks.

## Abstract

Automatic speech recognition systems are expected to faithfully transcribe speech signals that originate from diverse languages, dialects, accents, and domains, and that are captured under a wide variety of acoustic conditions. While conventional end-to-end models perform well on in-domain data, they still fall short of real-world requirements in challenging scenarios such as dialect mixing, code-switching, knowledge-intensive content, noisy environments, and multi-speaker conversations. Therefore, we present **MiMo-V2.5-ASR**, an end-to-end speech recognition model developed by the Xiaomi MiMo team. Through large-scale mid-training, high-quality supervised fine-tuning, and a novel reinforcement-learning algorithm, MiMo-V2.5-ASR achieves systematic improvements along the following dimensions:

- 🗣️ **Chinese Dialects**: Native support for Wu, Cantonese, Hokkien, Sichuanese, and more.
- 🔀 **Code-Switch**: Seamless Chinese–English code-switching transcription with no language tags required.
- 🎵 **Song Recognition**: High-precision lyrics transcription for Chinese and English songs, even with mixed accompaniment and vocals.
- 🔊 **Noisy Environments**: Robust recognition under heavy noise, far-field capture, and other adverse acoustic conditions.
- 👥 **Multi-Speaker**: Accurate transcription of overlapping, multi-party conversations such as meetings.
- 🇬🇧 **Complex English Scenarios**: Leading performance on the Open ASR Leaderboard for challenging English benchmarks such as AMI.
- 📚 **Knowledge-Intensive Recognition**: Precise recognition of classical poetry, technical terminology, personal names, place names, and other knowledge-dense material.
- 📝 **Native Punctuation**: Punctuation generated natively from prosody and semantics, delivering ready-to-use transcripts with no post-processing needed.

## Results

MiMo-V2.5-ASR has been evaluated across a broad set of benchmarks spanning standard Mandarin and English, Chinese dialects, lyric recognition, and internal business scenarios. The chart below summarizes the average performance of MiMo-V2.5-ASR across these scenarios.

## Getting Started

Spin up the MiMo-V2.5-ASR demo in minutes with the built-in Gradio app.

### Prerequisites (Linux)

* Python 3.12
* CUDA >= 12.0

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-V2.5-ASR.git
cd MiMo-V2.5-ASR
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash-attn==2.7.4.post1
```

> \[!Note]
> If the compilation of flash-attn takes too long, you can download the precompiled wheel and install it manually:

> * [Download Precompiled Wheel](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.7.4.post1/flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.6cxx11abiFALSE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl)
>
> ```sh
> pip install /path/to/flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.6cxx11abiFALSE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl
> ```

### Run the Demo

```bash
python run_mimo_asr.py
```

![MiMo-V2.5-ASR Demo](assets/MiMo_ASR_Demo.png)

This launches a local Gradio interface for MiMo-V2.5-ASR. You can:

* Upload an audio file **or** record directly from your microphone.
* Optionally specify a **language tag** (Chinese / English / Auto) to bias the model for a specific language, or leave it to **Auto** for automatic language detection (recommended for code-switched speech).
* The demo calls the `asr_sft()` interface under the hood.

To load the model and tokenizer automatically at startup, pass their paths on the command line:

```bash
python run_mimo_asr.py \
    --model-path ./models/MiMo-V2.5-ASR \
    --tokenizer-path ./models/MiMo-Audio-Tokenizer
```

Otherwise, enter the local paths for `MiMo-Audio-Tokenizer` and `MiMo-V2.5-ASR` in the **Model Configuration** tab, then start transcribing!

## Python API

Basic usage with the `asr_sft` interface:

```python
from src.mimo_audio.mimo_audio import MimoAudio

model = MimoAudio(
    model_path="./models/MiMo-V2.5-ASR",
    tokenizer_path="./models/MiMo-Audio-Tokenizer",
)

# Automatic language detection (recommended for code-switching)
text = model.asr_sft("path/to/audio.wav")
print(text)

# With explicit language tag
text_zh = model.asr_sft("path/to/audio.wav", audio_tag="<chinese>")
text_en = model.asr_sft("path/to/audio.wav", audio_tag="<english>")
```
