## I. Introduction

This repository provides the **official evaluation suite of MiMo-Embodied**, designed to support **rigorous** and **reproducible** evaluation for **embodied AI** and **autonomous driving** tasks.

Built on top of the excellent [lmms-eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval) framework, this repository extends the evaluation pipeline with MiMo-specific model integration, benchmark support, and evaluation workflows for embodied and driving scenarios.

**MiMo-Embodied** is a powerful cross-embodied vision-language model that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both **autonomous driving** and **embodied AI tasks**, representing the first open-source VLM that integrates these two critical areas.

> This repository is for **evaluation only**. It does **not** contain model training code.

## II. Key Features

### 1. `MiVLLM`: A MiMo-tailored vLLM-based Model Wrapper

We use a custom `mivllm` model class built on top of the original `VLLM` implementation in `lmms-eval`, tailored for MiMo models. Compared with the default implementation, it:

- improves **data loading efficiency**
- enables finer control over **image and video preprocessing**
- supports MiMo-specific inference settings such as:
  - `max_model_len`
  - `gpu_memory_utilization`
  - `max_num_seqs`

### 2. Evaluation for Embodied AI

This evaluation suite supports embodied AI benchmarks covering key capabilities such as:

- **affordance prediction**
- **task planning**
- **spatial understanding**

### 3. Evaluation for Autonomous Driving

This evaluation suite also supports autonomous driving benchmarks covering key capabilities such as:

- **environmental perception**
- **status prediction**
- **driving planning**
- **driving knowledge-based QA**

### 4. Flexible Evaluation Workflows

The framework supports:

- **single-GPU** evaluation
- **multi-GPU** evaluation
- **multi-node** distributed evaluation
- **batch evaluation** across multiple tasks

---

## IV. Usage

### Installation

```bash
# Step 1: Create conda environment
conda create -n lmms-eval python=3.10 -y
conda activate lmms-eval

# Step 2: Install PyTorch (adjust CUDA version as needed)
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

# Step 3: Install vLLM
pip install vllm==0.7.3

# Step 4: Install the evaluation framework
git clone https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-Embodied.git
cd MiMo-Embodied
pip install -e . && pip uninstall -y opencv-python-headless
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 5 (optional but recommended)
pip install xformers==0.0.28.post3
```

### Dataset Paths

For many benchmarks, images are already packaged in the corresponding Hugging Face dataset, so no additional local path configuration is required.

For some benchmarks with large image/video assets, the released config YAML uses a placeholder local path such as:

```yaml
img_root: "/path/to/your/image_or_video_data"
```

Before running evaluation for these benchmarks, please manually update `img_root` in the corresponding task YAML file to point to your local image/video directory.

For example:

```yaml
dataset_path: Zray26/bdd_x_testing_caption
task: "bddx"
test_split: test
dataset_kwargs:
  token: True

output_type: generate_until
img_root: "/path/to/your/image_or_video_data"
doc_to_visual: !function utils.doc_to_visual
doc_to_text: !function utils.doc_to_text
doc_to_target: !function utils.doc_to_target
process_results: !function utils.process_test_results_for_submission
```

A typical task folder is organized as:

```text
lmms_eval/tasks/<task_name>/
├── <task_name>.yaml
└── utils.py
```

For example:

```text
lmms_eval/tasks/bddx/
├── bddx.yaml
└── utils.py
```

Please check the YAML file of each benchmark case by case and fill in `img_root` when local image/video assets are required.

### Main Evaluation Script

The main evaluation launcher is:

```bash
bash mimovl_docs/eval_mimo_vl_args.sh <model_path> <task_name> <output_dir> [disable_thinking]
```

### Single-Task Evaluation

```bash
bash mimovl_docs/eval_mimo_vl_args.sh \
    XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-Embodied-7B \
    cvbench_boxed \
    ./eval_results
```

### No-Think Evaluation

For tasks evaluated in no-think mode, run:

```bash
bash mimovl_docs/eval_mimo_vl_args.sh \
    XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-Embodied-7B \
    <task_name> \
    ./eval_results \
    true
```

This corresponds to:

```bash
disable_thinking_user=true
```

### Multi-GPU / Multi-Node Evaluation

The launcher supports distributed evaluation through environment variables:

```bash
export NNODES=1
export NODE_RANK=0
export MASTER_ADDR=127.0.0.1
export MASTER_PORT=29500
export NPROC_PER_NODE=8
```

Then run:

```bash
bash mimovl_docs/eval_mimo_vl_args.sh \
    <model_path> \
    <task_name> \
    <output_dir>
```

### Batch Evaluation

To run multiple tasks sequentially, edit the task list in:

```bash
tools/submit/batch_run.py
```

Then launch:

```bash
python tools/submit/batch_run.py \
    --input <model_path> \
    --eval_results_dir <output_dir>
```

To disable thinking mode in batch evaluation:

```bash
python tools/submit/batch_run.py \
    --input <model_path> \
    --eval_results_dir <output_dir> \
    --disable_thinking_user
```

## VII. Evaluation Results

MiMo-Embodied demonstrates superior performance across **17 benchmarks in three key embodied AI capabilities: Task Planning, Affordance Prediction, and Spatial Understanding**, significantly surpassing existing open-source embodied VLM models and rivaling closed-source models.

Additionally, MiMo-Embodied excels in **12 autonomous driving benchmarks across three key capabilities: Environmental Perception, Status Prediction, and Driving Planning**—significantly outperforming both existing open-source and closed-source VLM models, as well as proprietary VLM models.

Moreover, evaluation on **8 general visual understanding benchmarks** confirms that MiMo-Embodied retains and even strengthens its general capabilities, showing that domain-specialized training enhances rather than diminishes overall model proficiency.

## VIII. Metric Definitions

The following table explains how the reported numbers in the evaluation tables are computed from the corresponding `result.json` files.

Unless otherwise specified:

- reported scores are shown in **percentage format**
- percentage scores are computed as `metric × 100`
- if a benchmark contains multiple subtasks, the reported score is the **arithmetic mean** of the corresponding subtask metrics
