## 1. Introduction
While generative artificial intelligence has advanced significantly across text, image, audio, and video domains, 3D generation remains comparatively underdeveloped due to fundamental challenges such as data scarcity, algorithmic limitations, and ecosystem fragmentation. 
To this end, we present Step1X-3D, an open framework addressing these challenges through: 
(1) a rigorous data curation pipeline processing >5M assets to create a 2M high-quality dataset with standardized geometric and textural properties; 
(2) a two-stage 3D-native architecture combining a hybrid VAE-DiT geometry generator 
with an SD-XL-based texture synthesis module; and (3) the full open-source release of models, training code, and adaptation modules. For geometry generation, the hybrid VAE-DiT component produces watertight TSDF representations by employing perceiver-based latent encoding with sharp edge sampling for detail preservation. The SD-XL-based texture synthesis module then ensures cross-view consistency through geometric conditioning and latent-space synchronization.
Benchmark results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that exceeds existing open-source methods, while also achieving competitive quality with proprietary solutions. 
Notebly, the framework uniquely bridges 2D and 3D generation paradigms by supporting direct transfer of 2D control techniques(e.g., LoRA) to 3D synthesis.
By simultaneously advancing data quality, algorithmic fidelity, and reproducibility, Step1X-3D aims to establish new standards for open research in controllable 3D asset generation.

Given the above high quality 3D assets, you can follow methods from [Dora](https://github.com/Seed3D/Dora/tree/main) to preprocess data for VAE and 3D DiT training, and from [MV-Adapter](https://github.com/huanngzh/MV-Adapter) for ig2mv training.
## 4. Dependencies and Installation
The dependencies configured according to the following instructions provide an environment equipped for both training and inference

### 4.1 Clone the repo
```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step1X-3D.git
cd Step1X-3D
```

> Shallow clone is faster and does not require pulling the gh-pages branch.
>
> Use the `git fetch --unshallow` command to convert a shallow clone to a full clone.
>
> Use the `git config remote.origin.fetch '+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*'` command to fetch all branches.
### 4.2 Create a new conda environment
```bash
conda create -n step1x-3d python=3.10
conda activate step1x-3d
```
### 4.3 Install the requrements
We have checked the environment in cuda12.4 and you can install cuda12.4 by following [CUDA Toolkit install guidance](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive).

```bash
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install torch-cluster -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.5.1+cu124.html
pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git@stable"
pip install kaolin==0.17.0 -f https://nvidia-kaolin.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/torch-2.5.1_cu124.html

cd step1x3d_texture/custom_rasterizer
python setup.py install
cd ../differentiable_renderer
python setup.py install
cd ../../
```
We reused custom_rasterizer and differentiable_renderer tools in [Hunyuan3D 2.0]((https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-2)) for the texture baker, thanks to their open-source contribution.

## 5. Inference Script

|                                                  | GPU Memory Usage | Time for 50 steps |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Step1X-3D-Geometry-1300m+Step1X-3D-Texture       | 27G              | 152 seconds       |
| Step1X-3D-Geometry-Label-1300m+Step1X-3D-Texture | 29G              | 152 seconds       |

We porvide the following example codes as tutorial to sequentially generate geometry and texture.
```python
import torch
# Stage 1: 3D geometry generation
from step1x3d_geometry.models.pipelines.pipeline import Step1X3DGeometryPipeline

# define the pipeline
geometry_pipeline = Step1X3DGeometryPipeline.from_pretrained("stepfun-ai/Step1X-3D", subfolder='Step1X-3D-Geometry-1300m'
).to("cuda")

# input image
input_image_path = "examples/images/000.png"

# run pipeline and obtain the untextured mesh 
generator = torch.Generator(device=geometry_pipeline.device).manual_seed(2025)
out = geometry_pipeline(input_image_path, guidance_scale=7.5, num_inference_steps=50)

# export untextured mesh as .glb format
out.mesh[0].export("untexture_mesh.glb")


# Stage 2: 3D texure synthsis
from step1x3d_texture.pipelines.step1x_3d_texture_synthesis_pipeline import (
    Step1X3DTexturePipeline,
)
from step1x3d_geometry.models.pipelines.pipeline_utils import reduce_face, remove_degenerate_face
import trimesh

# load untextured mesh
untexture_mesh = trimesh.load("untexture_mesh.glb")

# define texture_pipeline
texture_pipeline = Step1X3DTexturePipeline.from_pretrained("stepfun-ai/Step1X-3D", subfolder="Step1X-3D-Texture")

# reduce face
untexture_mesh = remove_degenerate_face(untexture_mesh)
untexture_mesh = reduce_face(untexture_mesh)

# texture mapping
textured_mesh = texture_pipeline(input_image_path, untexture_mesh)

# export textured mesh as .glb format
textured_mesh.export("textured_mesh.glb")
```

You can also run the the whole process by running
```bash
python inference.py
```

We also provide an interactive generation based on gradio with local deployment
```bash
python app.py
```
