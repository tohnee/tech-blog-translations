# Grok Imagine Video 1.5

Improved quality at even faster speeds.

Grok Imagine Video 1.5 is now generally available on the [Imagine API](https://console.x.ai/team/default/imagine?campaign=imagine-video-1-5-blog&mode=video). We've also rolled out Video 1.5 Fast on [grok.com/imagine](https://grok.com/imagine?referrer=website&campaign=imagine-video-1-5-blog) and our [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/grok-ai-chat-video/id6670324846) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.x.grok) apps. These are our best image-to-video models yet: better motion, better physics, better audio, at the fastest speeds. We’re also adding features to enhance your creative workflow in Grok Imagine.

Compared to the previous model, 1.5 improves across every dimension that matters for real creative work:

## [Audio and speech](#audio-and-speech)

Sound effects, ambience, and dialogue are generated in the same pass and land on the action. Speech is clearer and better synced.

## [Motion and physics](#motion-and-physics)

Movement holds together over the length of a clip — fewer warps, more believable weight and momentum.

## [Speed](#speed)

Grok Imagine Video 1.5 Fast almost doubles generation speed: it produces 6-second, 720p videos in about 25 seconds, down from 40+ seconds in our previous model.

## [Behind the Scenes - Odyssey](#behind-the-scenes---odyssey)

Take a look behind the scenes at how David Thompson ([@heavypulp](https://x.com/heavypulp)) made a trailer worthy of the big screen entirely with Grok Imagine 1.5:

### [Multiple agents](#multiple-agents)

Kick off multiple agents in parallel on your projects. Instead of waiting for one generation to finish before starting the next, you can run several prompts at once and let them work for you.

### [Search](#search)

Find any image or video you've made by searching your library — no more scrolling to track down that one clip.

## [Now out of preview in the API](#now-out-of-preview-in-the-api)

Imagine Video 1.5 is out of preview and generally available in the [xAI API](https://docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/video/generation) as `grok-imagine-video-1.5`. Give it a starting image, describe the motion, and choose your resolution and duration.

```
import os

client = xai_sdk.Client(api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"))

response = client.video.generate(
