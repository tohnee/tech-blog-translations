Pushing the Frontier of Cost-Efficient Intelligence

![Abstract digital hummingbird](/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fgrok-4-fast.aa4f6ad4.webp&w=3840&q=75)

We're thrilled to present Grok 4 Fast, our latest advancement in cost-efficient reasoning models. Built on xAI’s learnings from Grok 4, Grok 4 Fast delivers frontier-level performance across Enterprise and Consumer domains—with exceptional token efficiency. This model pushes the boundaries for smaller and faster AI, making high-quality reasoning accessible to more users and developers. Grok 4 Fast features state-of-the-art (SOTA) cost-efficiency, cutting-edge web and X search capabilities, a 2M token context window, and a unified architecture that blends `reasoning` and `non-reasoning` modes in one model.

## [Advancing Cost-Efficient Intelligence](#advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence)

Grok 4 Fast sets a new frontier in cost-efficient intelligence, outperforming Grok 3 Mini across reasoning benchmarks while slashing token costs.

## [Native Tool Use with SOTA Search](#native-tool-use-with-sota-search)

Grok 4 Fast was trained end-to-end with tool-use reinforcement learning (RL). It excels at deciding when to invoke tools like code execution or web browsing.

For instance, Grok 4 Fast exhibits frontier agentic search capabilities, seamlessly browsing the web and X to augment queries with real-time data. It hops through links, ingests media (including images and videos on X), and synthesizes findings at light speed.

| Benchmark pass@1 | Grok 4 Fast | Grok 4 | Grok 3 (No Reasoning) |

## [Frontier of General Post-training](#frontier-of-general-post-training)

Grok 4 Fast also establishes a new cost-effective frontier on general domain. We are excited to share Grok 4 Fast’s result on LMArena, where it has been privately battle-testing on the Search and Text Arenas.

In LMArena's [Search Arena](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/search), `grok-4-fast-search` (code name: `menlo`) claims ****#1**** with ****1163**** Elo — a commanding margin of ****17**** over `o3-search`. Its superior reasoning efficiency and intelligence density enable it to surpass much larger models on real-world, search-related tasks.

**4,250,334,444**

In Path of Exile 2, the maximum character level is 100, which requires a total of 4,250,334,444 experience points (XP) to reach from level 1. This value is the cumulative sum of XP needed for each level-up, based on the game's fixed experience table (identical to the original Path of Exile). After reaching level 100, additional XP can still be earned but does not grant further levels or meaningful progression.

To arrive at this total, the game's experience system uses a predefined table where each level requires progressively more XP. The "total XP" for level 100 is the sum of all XP thresholds from level 1 to 100. Here's how it's calculated step by step:

1. **Understand the XP structure:** Each level has an XP requirement to advance to the next (e.g., level 1 to 2 requires 525 XP). The total for a given level is the running sum of these requirements up to that point. Level 1 starts at 0 XP.
2. **Reference the experience table:** The official Path of Exile 2 data sources provide the full table. For example:
   - Level 2: 525 total XP (525 to gain from level 1).
   - Level 3: 1,760 total XP (1,235 to gain from level 2).
   - ...and so on, up to level 100.
3. **Sum the requirements:** Add up the XP needed for all 99 level-ups (from 1 to 100). This can be computed programmatically or from the table's cumulative values, yielding 4,250,334,444.

## [Unified Model: Reasoning and Non-Reasoning](#unified-model-reasoning-and-non-reasoning)

Previously, separate reasoning modes required distinct models. Grok 4 Fast introduces a unified architecture where `reasoning` (long chain-of-thought) and `non-reasoning` (quick responses) are handled by the same model weights, steered via system prompts. This unification reduces end-to-end latency as well as token costs, making Grok 4 Fast ideal for real-time applications.

In [grok.com](http://grok.com/?q=What%20is%20the%20answer%20to%20life,%20the%20universe,%20and%20everything?&m=7), this results in smooth transitions: responding instantly for simple queries or engaging in extended reasoning for complex ones. In the xAI API, developers can fine-tune this behavior, optimizing for speed or depth.
