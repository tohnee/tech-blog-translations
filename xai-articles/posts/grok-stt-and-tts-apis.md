Today, we are excited to announce two powerful standalone audio APIs: **Grok Speech to Text (STT)** and **Grok Text to Speech (TTS).** Built on the same stack that powers Grok Voice, Tesla vehicles, and Starlink customer support.

These standalone endpoints make it straightforward for developers to integrate high-quality speech features into any application, whether you're creating voice agents, real-time transcription tools, accessibility solutions, podcasts, or interactive audio experiences.

[Get Started](https://docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/audio/speech-to-text?campaign=stt-tts-blog)[Try Playground](https://console.x.ai/playground/voice/text-to-speech)

## [Speech to Text](#speech-to-text)

High accuracy, low latency.

- Generate transcripts from large audio files in milliseconds via our [REST API](https://docs.x.ai/developers/rest-api-reference/inference/voice#speech-to-text---rest)
- Transcribe speech in real time with our lowest latency [WebSocket API](https://docs.x.ai/developers/rest-api-reference/inference/voice#speech-to-text---streaming)

We’ve added powerful features like word-level timestamps, speaker diarization, and multichannel support. It further includes intelligent Inverse Text Normalization that correctly handles numbers, dates, currencies, and more.

### [Enterprise-Grade Transcription](#enterprise-grade-transcription)

Grok STT is evaluated against the top commercial models on phone calls, meetings, video/podcasts, and telephony. It excels at entity recognition and business use cases like medical, legal, and financial.

| Domain (Word Error Rate) | Grok STT | ElevenLabs | Deepgram | AssemblyAI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phone Call Entities | 5.0% | 12.0% | 13.5% | 21.3% |
| Video/Podcasts | 2.4% | 2.4% | 3.0% | 3.2% |
| Meetings | 10.9% | 12.2% | 16.3% | 15.7% |
| Telephone | 9.3% | 9.4% | 11.0% | 11.2% |
| Overall | 6.9% | 9.0% | 11.0% | 12.9% |

Most transcription models give you raw spoken words. Grok Speech to Text goes further.

When you enable formatting, the API performs advanced **Inverse Text Normalization** that intelligently converts spoken language into proper structured output:

My name is John Smith and my phone number is 4145551234.

I saw a transaction for 6.99 on my account.

### [Multilingual fluency](#multilingual-fluency)

The Grok Speech to Text API offers strong multilingual support across 25+ languages, switch languages seamlessly without missing a beat.

### [Multichannel & Diarization (Speaker Identification)](#multichannel--diarization-speaker-identification)

Transcribe multichannel audio files for perfect speaker separation with the same API.

Detect speakers in both pre-recorded and real-time streaming with word-level speaker IDs using Diarization.
